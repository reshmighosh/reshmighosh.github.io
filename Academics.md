### ACADEMICS
I am currently a first year Master of Computational Data Science student at Carnegie Mellon Universisty's School of Copmuter Science and will graduate in May 2021.
My coursework at CMU includes : 


Before transitioning into a Ph.D. program, I graduated with a master's degree (GPA: 3.7/4.0) from CMU in studying Engineering economics and Data Science as a part of my Advanced Infrastructure Systems concentration within CEE.

Inspired by my Ph.D. advisor I developed a strong liking towards solving societal problems using economic tools, and currently in my Ph.D. program I am leveraging data science techniques  **Python, R, MATLAB, and a little bit of C and C++**
