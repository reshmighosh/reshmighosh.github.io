### ACADEMICS
Along with my ongoing Ph.D. program, I have two other masters' degrees from Carnegie Mellon University:
M.S. in Engineering and Public Policy (Focus: Data Science techniques for Policy Analysis) and
M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Focus: Data Analytics for Engineered Systems)

Inspired by the bright minds of CMU, working on interdisciplinary research, I challenged myself to pursue both my masters' degree with a focus in data-driven analysis, a unqiue unique pathway to learn and use data science to inform decisions for the society.This meant taking up a unique blend of courses related to machine learning and advanced economic analysis. 

Currently in my Ph.D. program I am leveraging data science techniques to develop probabilistic metrics to  I am proficient in **Python**, and **SQL**, I and familiar with the working of **Matlab**, and **C**. I also have experience working with python based Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries  like **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, statsmodel, Matplotlib, PyTorch**, etc.

I have always strived to maintain a consistent academic record while participating in numerous extra-curriculars. Some of my achievements include:
- Receiving a Dean's fellowship to support my Ph.D. degree
- Receiving two academic scholarships (worth $18,000) in 2016 & 2017 from CMU to support my master's education
- Finalist at Yale University's Consulting Case Competition, 2019

Applying my skills to solve societal problems by leveraging my background in applied statistics, data science, economics, and consulting, this endeavor was only made possible by the courses I undertook at CMU, some of which are:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning (Ph.D. level)
2. Decision Analytics for Business and Policy (Operations Research Math)
3. Practical Data Science
4. Applied Machine Learning
5. Applied Data Analysis
6. Data Analytics for Engineered Systems
7. Ph.D. Microeconomics
8. Investment Planning and Pricing
9. Energy Policy and Economics
10. Risk Analytics
11. Business Intelligence and Data Mining
12. Python for Developers
13. Theory and Applications of Policy Analysis
14. Graduate Probability and Statistics
15. Multi-Criteria Decision Making
16. Inroduction to Sustainable Engineering
17. Data Warehousing
18. Building Controls and Diagnostics
