### ACADEMICS
I am a rising third-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. My research work lies in the nexus of data science, economics, and public policy. Before transitioning into a Ph.D. program, I graduated with a master's degree (GPA: 3.7/4.0) from CMU.  

In my master's program, I undertook a non-traditional route and developed robust foundation in engineering economics and data science as a part of my Advanced Infrastructure Systems concentration within CEE. During this time, I was also awarded two scholarships by CMU (worth $18,000) aiding the degree. 

Inspired by my Ph.D. advisor I developed a strong liking towards solving societal problems using economic tools, and currently in my Ph.D. program I am leveraging data science techniques to analyze financial forecasts of wind energy. I am proficient in **Python**, **R**, **MATLAB**, and familiar with the working of **C**. I also have experience working with python based Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries  like **numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pytorch**, etc.

I have always been interested in solving optimization problems with
