### ACADEMICS
Before transitioning into a Ph.D. program, I graduated with a master's degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University(CMU). Inspired by the bright minds of CMU, working on interdisciplinary research, I challenged myself to pursue the master's with a focus in Advanced Infrastructure Systems(AIS), a unqiue unique pathway to learn and use data science to inform decisions for the society.This meant taking up a unique blend of courses related to machine learning and advanced economic analysis. 

Currently in my Ph.D. program I am leveraging data science techniques to analyze financial forecasts of wind energy. I am proficient in **Python**, **R**, **MATLAB**, and familiar with the working of **C**. I also have experience working with python based Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries  like **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, PyTorch**, etc.

I have always strived to maintain a good academic record while participating in numerous extra-curriculars. Some of my achievements include:
- Receiving a Dean's fellowship to support my Ph.D. degree
- Receiving two academic scholarships (worth $18,000) from CMU to support my master's education
- Excelllent performance in science core course, ranking amongst the top 0.1% of all students who appeared in the country-wide 10th-grade examination (2008)

Applying my skills to solve societal problems by leveraging my background in data, economics, and consulting, this endeavor was only made possible by the courses I undertook at CMU, some of which are:

1. Practical Data Science
2. Decision Analytics for Business and Policy (Operations Research Math)
3. Introduction to Deep Learning (ongoing)
4. Applied Machine Learning
5. Applied Data Analysis
6. Data Analytics for Engineered Systems
7. Ph.D. Microeconomics
8. Systems Investment Planning and Pricing
9. Energy Policy and Economics
10. Risk Management
11. Business Intelligence and Data Mining
12. Python for Developers
13. Theory and Applications of Policy Analysis
14. Graduate Probability and Statistics
15. Multi-Criteria Decision Making
16. Inroduction to Sustainable Engineering
17. Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment
18. Data Warehousing
19. Building Controls and Diagnostics
