### ACADEMICS
Along with my ongoing Ph.D. program, I have two other masters' degrees from Carnegie Mellon University:
M.S. in Engineering and Public Policy (Focus: Data Science techniques for Policy Analysis) and
M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Focus: Data Analytics for Engineered Systems)

Inspired by the bright minds of CMU, working on interdisciplinary research, I challenged myself to pursue both my masters' degree with a focus in data-driven analysis, a unqiue pathway to learn and use machine learning to inform decisions for businesses and policy making.

Currently in my Ph.D. program I am leveraging machine and deep learning techniques to stochastically analyze resource adequacy metrics required to measure the effect of large-scale integration of renewable energy sources in the existing grid.

I am proficient in **Python**, **Pytorch**, and **SQL**, I and familiar with the working of **Matlab**, and **C**. I also have experience working with python based Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries  like **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, statsmodels, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, TensorFlow**, etc.

Applying my skills to solve societal problems by leveraging my background in applied statistics, data science, economics, and consulting, this endeavor was only made possible by the courses I undertook at CMU, some of which are:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning (Ph.D. level)
2. Decision Analytics for Business and Policy (Operations Research Math)
3. Practical Data Science
4. Applied Machine Learning
5. Applied Data Analysis
6. Data Analytics for Engineered Systems
7. Ph.D. Microeconomics
8. Investment Planning and Pricing
9. Energy Policy and Economics
10. Risk Analytics
11. Business Intelligence and Data Mining
12. Python for Developers
13. Theory and Applications of Policy Analysis
14. Graduate Probability and Statistics
15. Multi-Criteria Decision Making
16. Inroduction to Sustainable Engineering
17. Data Warehousing
