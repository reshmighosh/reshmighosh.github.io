### PROJECTS

During the course of my graduate studies I completed a series of academic and personal projects, with active participation in competitions like the MIT Energy Hackathon, Yale Graduate Case Competition(YGCC), Duke Graduate Case Competition, etc. During YGCC my team was one of the finalists in the competition, where we were touted as one of the most innovative teams to present a strategic solution to revolutionize electric scooter business using data-driven analysis.

Some of my other academic and personal projects are listed below:
