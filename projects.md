        <td>Leveraged the  VizWiz dataset (collection of 20,000 images captured by blind people through their mobile phones) to implement MobileNetv3 (CNN model) \& an LSTM based language model to develop a Visual Question Answering based framework. Achieved an accuracy of approximately 60\% using PyTorch library and NVIDIA K80 GPUs on AWS. </a></td>

        <td>Conducted end-to-end data analysis to examine user behavior on Instagram about climate change by using unsupervised clustering techniques on web-scraped images \& associated hashtags. Determined that only ~10\% of all users posted relevant climate change related content between November-December'19.

        <td> The aim of the project was to augment enrollment strategy for Udacity. Coducted A/B Testing on a large dataset of students enrolling for *free* courses on Udacity to analyze the effect of 'studytime-filter' on students. Concluded based on statistically significant conversion rate numbers that filter shouldn't be launched.
