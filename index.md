I'm Reshmi, a final year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, set to graduate in 2021. I have always been passionate about machine learning, deep learning, economics, climate change, and renewable energy. I have 5+ years of working with data-driven techniques in python to discover underlying patterns in large datasets. I love leveraging data science techniques to derive key actionable insights about business and societal problems, and translating these insights into business strategies.

 My doctoral research reflects the blend of of my interest areas in a public policy setting. I am analyzing the future reliability of power systems for the United States by developing probabilistic mathematical models using terrabytes of reanalysis datasets to measure the resource adequacy metrics. Additionally, I am also working to reconstruct decades of missing electricity demand data using advanced regression and deep learning based LSTM models (vanilla and with Attention).

**UPDATES**
1. Presented research poster at [WindEurope Technology Workshop 2020](https://windeurope.org/workshops/tech2020/posters/#ra) (virtual owing to Covid restrictions) on the changing variance of wind speeds due to climatological impacts, *June 2020*.
2. Graduated with second Master of Science degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Engineering and Public Policy, *May 2020*.
3. Inducted as a part of research team at [Asset Lab](https://www.assetlab.org/people), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor to use stochastic methods to assess future grid reliability and also leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover patterns in large time series data with Prof. Michael Craig, *April 2020*.
4. Selected to present first year doctoral work at the prestigious [American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) Clean Power Expo and Conferece](https://cleanpower.org/expo/), *May 2019*
5. Finalist at national level Yale Graduate Consulting Case competition, *March 2019*
6. Elected to receive Dean's fellowship to support doctoral studies, *March 2018*
7. Awarded doctoral fellowship by [CMU Portugal](https://www.cmuportugal.org/atlantic/) to work on the +Atlantic project - a consortium of 8 cross-functional research and academic institutions from Portugal working towards assessing the technological and economical impacts of developing energy industries in the Atlantic Ocean, *January 2018*.
8. Graduated with a Master of Science degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and started working as a Research Intern with Prof. H. Scott Matthews on ecnomic analysis and risk analysis for Deep-sea mining and Offshore wind farm infrastruture in the Atlantic region *December 2017*.
9. Received Merit Scholarship from Carnegie Mellon to support master's studies in the academic year 2017-2018, *March 2017*.
10. Received Civil and Environmental Engineering department scholarship to support master's studies for the academic year 2016-2017. Scholarship resulted in 25% tuition waiver, *January 2016*.
