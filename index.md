### &emsp;&emsp; ABOUT  &emsp; [ACADEMICS](./Academics.md) &emsp; [PROJECTS](./projects) &emsp;


Reshmi is an Applied Scientist at Microsoft's Intelligent Search team (MSAI), currently involved in R&D and productionization of several **natural language and multimodal solutions for securing Copilot reasoning and enterprise RAG** from adversarial users. Most recently, she also contributed towards the post-training of AI-systems for aligning with human-preferences while ensuring safe search experiences. Reshmi loves working in fast-paced teams and has a rich experience of delivering high-impact features/products for Fortune 500 companies and end users. She also loves prototyping and working on incubation projects, an desire stemming from her past experience of finishing a forward-looking Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in the intersection of deep learning, natural language processing, and renewable energy policies. 

### Overview:
In the past 2 years of AI revolution, she has been focused on developing state-of-the-art Responsible AI and Trustworthy evaluation mechanisms for LLM and Multimodal model applications. Additionally, in 2023, Reshmi contributed to the development and shipped M365Copilot (Business Chat), followed by Azure Prompt Shileds in 2024. Shortly before that, she was tech leading efforts to architect and integrate first-ever Generative AI capabilities in Microsoft's Productivity applications (M365 CoPilots, see Satya Nadella's announcement of these products [here](https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/)). 

Before joining MSAI, Reshmi was selected to be part of the highly coveted (~0.1% acceptance rate) [AI incubation program](https://www.microsoftnewengland.com/maidap/) at Microsoft's New England Research and Development Center (NERD) (currently under the Office of the CTO, previously under Jaime Teevan's Office of Applied Research). During this time, she worked on several incubation projects, notably:
1. Developed and implemented anomaly detection methods for SLA in Azure core services
2. Developed and deployed in production, intelligent commanding features leveraging seq2seq language model to Microsoft Office. Also prototyped a novel loss function that can predict as well as researching user preferences in UX positioning by developing a novel loss function.
3. Developed probablistic graphical models to measure time saved in finding new information by knowledge workers, aiding in productivity increases through Viva Topics (see product announcement [here](https://venturebeat.com/business/microsoft-launches-viva-topics-an-ai-powered-information-curator-for-enterprises/)!)
4. Shipped a LLM application and novel evaluation framework for generating rich-text formatting within a client application.

Prior to joining Microsoft, Reshmi graduated with a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021. She has always been passionate about machine learning, deep learning, economics, climate change, and renewable energy. With over 8+ years of working with data-driven techniques in python to discover underlying patterns in large datasets. I love leveraging data science techniques to derive key actionable insights about business and societal problems, and translating these insights into business strategies.

Her doctoral research reflects the blend of of my interest areas in a public policy setting for energy systems. I am analyzing the future reliability of power systems for the United States by **developing probabilistic mathematical models** using terrabytes of reanalysis datasets to measure the resource adequacy metrics. Additionally, I am also working to reconstruct decades of missing electricity demand data using **large seq2seq models for detecting anomalous behavior (vanilla and with Attention)**. I am also attempting to use causal inference methods to identify underlying patterns in multi-decadal electricity load data, and understand it's implication on grid system.
