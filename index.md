-------  



I'm Reshmi, a rising third year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, set to graduate in May 2021. I have always been passionate about data, economics, and also about the domains of renewable energy and electricity market. My research reflects the blend of of my interest areas in a public policy setting. I am analyzing the present day economics of offshore wind resources and the variabity in costs associated with related technologies and electricity distribution, along with its public policy implications.
