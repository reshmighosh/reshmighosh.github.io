-------  



I'm Reshmi, a final year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, set to graduate in 2021. I have always been passionate about machine learning, deep learning, economics, and also about the domains of renewable energy and electricity market. My research reflects the blend of of my interest areas in a public policy setting. I am analyzing the future reliability of power systems for the United States by developing probabilistic mathematical models using terrabytes of reanalysis datasets to measure the resource adequacy metrics. Additionally, I am also working to reconstruct decades of missing electricity demand data using advanced regression and deep learning based LSTM models.
