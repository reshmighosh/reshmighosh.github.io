### &emsp;&emsp; ABOUT  &emsp; [ACADEMICS](./Academics.md) &emsp; [PROJECTS](./projects) &emsp;


I'm Reshmi, a Ph.D. Applied Scientist at Microsoft's highly coveted AI rotational program. I recently completed a project with Microsoft Office to improve upon a intelligent commanding feature, wherein I developed novel loss functions for a Transformer based model in production to improve user experience. 

Prior to joining Microsoft, I graduated with a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021. I have always been passionate about machine learning, deep learning, economics, climate change, and renewable energy. I have 5+ years of working with data-driven techniques in python to discover underlying patterns in large datasets. I love leveraging data science techniques to derive key actionable insights about business and societal problems, and translating these insights into business strategies.

 My doctoral research reflects the blend of of my interest areas in a public policy setting for energy systems. I am analyzing the future reliability of power systems for the United States by **developing probabilistic mathematical models** using terrabytes of reanalysis datasets to measure the resource adequacy metrics. Additionally, I am also working to reconstruct decades of missing electricity demand data using **large seq2seq models for detecting anomalous behavior (vanilla and with Attention)**. I am also attempting to use causal inference methods to identify underlying patterns in multi-decadal electricity load data, and understand it's implication on grid system.
